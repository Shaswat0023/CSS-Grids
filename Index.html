            <p class="one">A grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a pattern against which we can line up our design elements. They help us to create layouts in which our elements wont jump around or change width as we move from page, providing greater consistency on our websites.</p>
            <ul class="one">
                <ol>
                    <li>CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web.</li>
                    <li>It lets you lay content out in rows and columns.</li>
